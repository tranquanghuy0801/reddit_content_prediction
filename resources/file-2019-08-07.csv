We're part of an organisation called JCI Eastern that hosts social and community events and provides consulting services to not for profits and charities.

We are currently conducting a survey for a not for profit regarding the perceived cultural gap in universities between domestic and international students. We have created a questionnaire in order to gain an understanding of why this gap exists and to look for ways to bridge the gap. We are also planning on sharing our survey results with Australian universities to provide them with data and possible solutions so as to make university life more enjoyable for everyone.

Here is a link to the survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPxP-z5RxEktnm5Prz1gU3pb5\_m5\_j1Hg3k5au12P6X91XgQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPxP-z5RxEktnm5Prz1gU3pb5_m5_j1Hg3k5au12P6X91XgQ/viewform)

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",1557817227.0

If anyone is currently studying IT and interested in working full-time in the field, please feel free to ask me any questions and apply. IT work experience is obviously desired but not necessary.

2. How fucked am I studying a non-english course?

Additionally, is there any way to study a strict core set of units that are more likely available for overseas study? Say, healthcare or pharmacology aspects that still give credit to my degree.

49,Marked down to a 0 for almost all of my assignment for simple referencing error - worth appealing?

eg.

(Smith, J. (2019))

As opposed to 

(Smith, 2019)

&#x200B;

This has resulted in a mark of zero for incorrect referencing in all of the sections I have used it, and has dropped my grade from what should have been a solid 4-5 assignment to a low fail 2-3.

I understand it was my error and I should have looked at the referencing format more carefully, but as it is such a minor mistake I was wondering if it is possible, or ""worth it""  to take it up with someone to potentially restore the marks, as aside from the minor mistake the assignment is reasonably well constructed.

I've been using this degree to hopefully lay out the foundation to pursue further into medicine at UQ with hopefully taking and passing the GAMSAT/interviews but after some self-reflection on my priorities, personal values and advice from career support, I'm doubting if going into med school is something I can commit to and thus, I'm considering a switch to a double degree on Nursing/Paramedic Science next year (unsure if there is a mid year entry for it?). Right now, I'm sitting at a 5.5 GPA, equivalent of 97 on the ATAR (current rank plays out at 92)... at least, I'm eligible.  I should also mention that I've completed one of the units under Nursing as it was part of my second major (LQB185 - Anatomy and Physio for Health Professionals) with a 70% in my first year second semester and considering how this would affect my study plan for that degree should I choose to move forward, given I'd apply for advanced standing.

Ok to start of things, im a international student from Singapore looking to apply to QUT’s CI majoring in media comms. from what I understand, QUT is known to be more hands on and artsy in a sense compared to the group of 8’s (top Aussie unis) degree in media comms where they are more book based. 

I have a diploma in business marketing but enjoy creating content like videos and photography on the side- I’m a very visual person not Super book smart. But it’s JUST a hobby, I don’t think I’m actually good enough to do that as a profession hence not going into that field. 

my concern is that I’m not sure how recognised is degree of QUT’s CI in the workforce (especially in Singapore) since the ranking of the uni isn’t very high. also I’ve been reading the reddit threads that it’s really not worth the money as things taught there are very surface and basically ‘fun’ stuff which yes I’ll enjoy but not drilled for the real world. Also, as I’m not a mass Comm student would I lag behind in terms of broadcasting/journalism (which I’m Super bad at) haha. Will I have to take those as part of the core subjects? 

So I’m thinking should I just stick to the group of 8’s business course but major in marketing or just apply for QUT CI’s?

How is the transfer process at QUT,particularly for engineering to IT? :

1. Do I have to apply for advance standing for units that I have done? Or do they automatically added to my IT degree? 

2.How do i choose which units that I want to include to my IT degree?

3. Dothe marks for the units that I have done stay? or is it just written as ""credit""? I wan the mark to stay actually.

The other CS student is international transfer student and he's never used python before and he claimed he's never heard of python before. He hasn't learned django and python up until this week. Also, he hasn't contributed to anything so far, not even user stories,release plan etc. He basically does nothing. I don't believe he will be able to learn python and django in the coming weeks to contribute to the project.

Out of 3 IS students, only 1 who is performing, and we reckon that he will be doing more programming stuffs since one of the CS student doesn't seem to have learned python and django. The other 1 IS student  is performing decently, though he doesn't understand what's going on. The last 1 IS student has not contributed much (a couple of wrong user stories and that's it),skipped a couple of meetings and classes.

Is it normal? I am really worried about this unit since all teams in my tutorial class performs much better than our groups since they have capable members. 

I am asking this to know if this situation is normal.

There are a couple that looks interesting, however all of them  some sort of conflict or issue.
So I've decided to do the Networks and Security minor already but I just need to find my second minor.

Data centric computing minor looked interesting, but found that Network and Data shared a common subject meaning I would need to do that subject twice.

Computational Simulation Science also looked interesting, but it's mainly Math B assumed knowledge and while I did pass Math B, it was just barely(got a C) and frankly doing hard math is not really my thing at all.

Intelligent Systems is exactly what I came into IT for. AI and Robotics, though one of it's subjects(MXB103) says that Math B is assumed knowledge so while I may struggle, I'm fine with doing a single mathsy subject plus I have 3 friends who have all done that subject so they could tutor me. The main issue is another one of the subjects (EGB339) has MZB126 as it's assumed knowledge, and MZB126 is a full on hard math C style engineering subject. See above paragraph as to why I might have issues with that.

Enterprise Systems also looked interesting, but it had prerequisites from the Information Systems minor plus would make me have to wait an extra year due to conflicting semesters.

Mobile Applications had issues with it's electives. Either we picked 2 electives from the ""technical stream"" or 2 electives from the ""non-technical stream"" and the technical stream only offers 3 subjects, one of which is in the Networks minor again and another I've already completed as my optional from the core subject list. Meaning that there's only one subject left in the technical stream and you have to pick two. So I'm forced to do irrelevant subjects in the Non technical one.

So all 5 of the minors I liked can't work really. There's also the added problem of timetabling. Basically all of these minors have two subjects in semester 1 and two subjects in semester 2. However, we aren't given equal slots for semester 1 and 2 in the recommended course guide. We are given 3 slots for semester 1 and 5 slots in semester 2 to fit our minors into.

At this point I'll be happy to just do electives instead of a second minor, but from what I can tell, there's no electives listed for my course. So I'm screwed.",1515894359.0

I would have probably lived for a few weeks if it wasn't for their inflexible accommodation contract. Basically, I need a place to crash. I've made friends with some strangers online living in brisbane who are offering me a place to crash for a week during arrival (i don't trust those cunts)  but they seem to live really far away (like 1hr drive away, thats what they say) . I don't even plan on owning a car. 

**Is there other option for me?** I want to live somewhere around wollongabba, spring hill, south Brisbane because it will be easier to commute. Kelvin's grove seems nice too but I want you guy's input if living in kelvin's grove is a good decision or not.  I am taking advice from other people by not booking online through suspicious websites. However, there I a few which I think are legit.

 **Is www.padrooms.com.au a trust-worthy website?** I liked some of their rooms and they have online booking too. Or should I just stay over at temporary place and start room-hunting only after arriving?

How's the job market. Can a student find employment in supermarkets, restaurants and likewise. **What's your advice on getting casual jobs. How should i prepare for better job prospects.**

I know I sound a bit paranoid. But this is a big move for me. I am very excited to be a part of QUT and I want to enjoy the coming years of my life in brisbane... responsibly.

I'll be moving to Brisbane to attend QUT Gardens Point in semester 1 2017 and I'm in a conundrum of choosing where to live. Right now I'm looking at:
UniLodge South Bank, UniLodge on Margeret, Iglu Brisbane City, Urbanest South Bank, Unilodge @ Shafston.
I'm looking for advice on which of these to choose or if there are better alternatives. As a start point, I would prefer to have my own room, so a studio or apartment is what I would choose. If you all could help me out in deciding which of these could get me the most bang for my buck in terms of room size and what the complex has to offer (gym, pool, facilities, utilities included, quality of room, amenities, community of students, what the surrounding area has to offer in terms of food, nightlife etc).

 The main reason I was looking at places such as Unilodge etc were because all the bills (electricity, water, gym etc) are included in rent, and because they have that program where they'll have planned trips.
I know I definitely want to have my own living space, but I also want to be near all the commotion.

In regards to my budget, as I currently live in the SF bay area I'm used to paying outrageous rent as it is, having said that however, I'm aiming for 300-500/week.

The nanny state means no fires on the beaches and no nothing which are restrictions you dont have in other places. Tourism down. Mining important, and farming important. Government protects them and makes sure they run ok, and everyone else basically serves food or counts numbers for the government and everyone doing this fights each morning to get into the place where this happens in the CBD and it's impossible to do this.

I'm fresh out of high-school, and decided to opt for MZB126 instead of MZB125, despite not doing maths C (IT and maths C were on the same line). I did this because 126 is compulsory, while 125 is not. Many people have told me I'm crazy, and I should switch now, but (although I respect their opinions) I still want to give this course a go, at the risk of failure. So I just wanted to ask experienced students, if they have any tips, knowledge, and other things that may help. Maybe some learning resources you've used to help you understand the subject better.

I've already read the unit outline, and found what the assumed knowledge is (Luckily, the majority of the topics were covered in maths B, and I did self study on a few of the maths C topics, as it related closely to what I was doing in IT [plus it was fun 😀])

I've also read the blackboards, and some previous lecture notes, and slides from previous semesters and found them to be very helpful (I don't know if I can access lecture videos).

Any other tips, lectures, or topics I should give special attention to, or anything else that will help me get ahead will be greatly appreciated.

incoming master level accounting student, so I guess my campus is Garden's Point. Coming over for a single semester bilateral exchange. I am looking for an apartment, but I was reading some old reports by people from my school who also went, and it turns out a lot of people were scammed out of their deposits, even when they left their room / apartment in perfect order. That really scares me to be honest. Like, I'm talking, QUT directed some of these people to landlords, and those guys fucked them over. Apparently it's so difficult to get the deposit back when you leave the country, so the landlords sometimes fuck over the exchange students. 

So, would you have any tips for me? Who can I trust, and where should I live? I am currently living in a 16m^2 apartment, so all I need is a comfortable room, anything that will get me close. The highest monthly rent I would like to pay is $800 AUD, so $200 / week. I know they say Australia is expensive, but shit, surely I can get a single room fairly close for $800?

I am about to study the first semester of 2016 at QUT as an international student via the study abroad program. There are still a few issues, which are unclear to me, and maybe someone here can help me a bit.

In my eCoE it is said, that the total tuition fee would be $AU 9,828.
Is this really the final amount i will have to pay? I thought i would pay per unit, that's why im a bit confused.

For the initial enrollment into the units, i can only choose units, which have been approved for me or appear in the pre approved unit list, right?

If i enroll myself into 3 units only, would i still be considered a full-time student at QUT?

I was told i could switch units up until the second week of semester. Is that true? And how would that exactly work, e.g. which units would be available to choose for me then?

Including taking their phones and voting for them while in line. 

This is not the first time the student guild has misappropriated funds. I suggest that maybe the university look into the spending of the guild, specifically looking into people who are no longer in the guild but still getting paid.

I know some people are struggling with the email logins, so to stop the IT Helpdesk getting swamped (and stop everyone wasting their own time), the Logins have changed and here's what you need to know:


**Logins and Emails Have Changed**

Your Outlook account is now registered to **n1234567@qut.edu.au** - notice the lack of the *connect*.
This does *not* mean that *connect* is gone, and in fact, if you'd rather not use your *n12345678* address to communicate with the world, you can *still use* your *@connect* email address.

---

**Mobile Phones**

Choose your Exchange Active Sync account. Enter your **@connect.edu.au** email address, and choose teh server as **outlook.office365.edu.au**. For Username, use **n12345467@qut.edu.au** and your **QUT Access Password**.

---
**Outlook**

Same goes for most other Email clients.

If you use the normal Add Email Account method, put in your **@connect.qut.edu** email address, with your Access Password. When prompted with the little Windows Signon Box, put in the **n12345678@qut.edu.au** email and your access password. You might have to do this twice before it works.

---
Hope that helps everyone.

This allows you to continue using the **firstname.lastname** format, without having to use the numbered email address. It's simply changing the login format. Your email has multiple 'aliases' that it can operate under, this being one of them.

The second is that when I enrolled, not all of the tutes were made available, specifically the 7pm to 8pm tute straight after the lecture. Now presumably it was opened later, but of course is now full because all the waitlisted people were put into it automatically.

this semester though, the genius at the parking office thought it was a good idea to close the car park every time someone started queuing inside the car park instead of driving through and exiting.

Last week was a great example at his logic, there were about 20 cars queuing outside of the car park, waiting for it to open and about 40 available car parks inside (a friend jumped out and counted them as i waited in the car)

They refused to open the car park until the queue had gone... 

my logic: the queue would be gone if they opened up the car park.

why can't they just guide cars down to where the car parks are and make them move on, instead of two of them standing at the entrance way looking smug.

I use public transport other days but need to drive on these two days. I might just have to park at a train station close by and train / walk the rest of the way.

It is not all bad but I have come to realise I am not that kind of touchy feely person. I want to jump ship and the QUT degree looks great but I wanted to get a heads up about what it is actually like from someone who is currently doing it. I live in Queensland so the compulsory attendances are manageable. 

I just want to know from what perspective is the degree taught. Is there a 'black letter' base to the degree or is it more social justice orientated? How is a QUT degree regarded in Qld? I have just moved here and other than knowing UQ, as a GO8 member is supposedly amazing I really have no idea. Also, obvious question but is it a hard degree? SCU offers eternal extensions, open book exams and it is basically impossible to fail any unit unless you specifically ask the lecturer to fail you.
